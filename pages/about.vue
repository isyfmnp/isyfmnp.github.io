          Innovation Unified: Towards a Better Future
        </PrimaryHighlight>
      </h2>

      <p>
        "Innovation Unified" expresses the collaborative spirit and shared aspirations of young scientists in research and discovery of the world. This theme highlights the importance of unity and humility in the pursuit of groundbreaking discoveries and novel ideas. ISYF, likewise, facilitates meaningful conversations amongst bright young minds where diverse perspectives from delegates converge, exploring interdisciplinary approaches to solve global challenges. As young scientists, it is a common goal for us to envision a future of science and technology where collective innovation drives a positive change in society.

        <div>
          <h3>Inspire Passion for Science Among Youth</h3>
          <p>
            ISYF aims to provide students who are highly inquisitive and
            passionate about the sciences with ample opportunities to share and
            discuss their interests in Science, technology and scientific
            research. They will be exposed to many fields of science which will
            broaden their outlook and understanding of the scientific world.
            Invited Nobel laureates and eminent scientists will inspire them
            through stories of their own life experiences and scientific
            discoveries. These interactions will help create greater awareness
            among the youth about the importance of broad-based knowledge, fuel
            their curiosity, engender relentless tenacity and a global outlook
            when considering the pursuit of science as a meaningful and
            fulfilling endeavour.
